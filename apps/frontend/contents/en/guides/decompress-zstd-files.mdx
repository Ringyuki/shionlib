## Why we use zstd compression

To better balance download speed, file size, and server cost, Shionlib resources will progressively use zstd (Zstandard) compression.

In most cases, zstd provides better compression than traditional formats while still keeping decompression fast.

## Before extracting, check these points

- Use an extractor that supports `zstd`, or you may see errors like “unknown format” or “corrupted file”.
- We do not use `.zst` as the download file extension. Even when a file has another common archive extension, make sure your extractor supports the `zstd` algorithm.
- Download extraction software from official sources whenever possible, and avoid unknown repackaged builds.

## Recommended extraction tools

### PC

- [7-Zip (Windows)](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- [Bandizip (Windows / macOS)](https://www.bandisoft.com/bandizip/)

### Mobile

- [ZArchiver (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver)
- [Keka (iOS / iPadOS)](https://ios.keka.io/)

> Supported formats may vary by version. If your current app cannot open `zstd`-compressed files, update to the latest version and try again.

## FAQ

### What if the file is reported as corrupted?

First verify the download completed fully, then re-download once. If it still fails, try the latest 7-Zip or Bandizip build.

### What if extraction fails on mobile?

Update the app to a recent version first. If it still fails, extract on PC and transfer the extracted files back to your phone.
