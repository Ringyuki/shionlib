## Before You Start

This guide answers one practical question: after downloading a game package, which emulator/runtime should you use?

Two core rules:

- If a native build is available (for example, a Windows executable), prefer native first.
- If you need an emulator, prioritize projects with public source code and active maintenance.

## Quick Mapping

Android / iOS resources are labeled with a **Simulator Engine** tag.  
Current tag values are: `KRKR` / `ONS` / `ARTEMIS` / `OTHER`.

This tag describes the engine type of the package; it is not always a single mandatory app name.

- KRKR / ONS / ARTEMIS (Android): start with the latest Tyranor package  
  [Tyranor 2.3.3 APK](https://t.shionlib.com/tools/Tyranor%202.3.3.APK)
- KRKR / ONS (iOS): install the corresponding emulators directly from the App Store.
- OTHER: follow release-page notes for the runtime method.

Recent Tyranor builds can cover common KRKR, ONS, and Artemis scenarios. If a release page requires a specific patch or runtime method, follow that release note first.

## Platform Recommendations

### Windows

- Prefer native launchers first.
- If a release explicitly requires a specific environment/patch, follow the release instructions.

### Android

- Check the resource card's Simulator Engine tag first (KRKR / ONS / ARTEMIS / OTHER).
- KRKR / ONS / ARTEMIS: use Tyranor 2.3.3 first.
- OTHER or compatibility issues: switch according to the release-page note.

### iOS

- Tyranor is currently not available on iOS.
- iOS users should install KRKR / ONS emulators from the App Store based on the engine tag.
- For ARTEMIS or OTHER tags, prioritize the release-page compatibility note.

## FAQ

### The game launches but shows black screen / crashes

Try another emulator version for the same engine first, then check whether the release notes require a specific patch or a specific emulator version.

### I cannot identify the engine

Check the release-page notes first. If it is not specified, inspect the folder structure and launcher filename. If still unclear, ask the uploader in comments.
