## Saving a Game

On a game entry page, click the **Favorite** button to open the folder list. The list shows all your folders and the number of titles in each. Click a folder to add the game; click it again to remove it.

A game can be added to multiple folders at the same time.

## Default Folder

Every user has a **Default Folder** created automatically by the system. It cannot be deleted and its name cannot be changed, but you can edit its description and privacy setting.

## Creating Custom Folders

At the bottom of the favorites popup, click **Create Folder** and fill in the following:

- **Name** — Folder name (required, 1–12 characters)
- **Description** — Optional description of the folder (max 200 characters)
- **Private Folder** — Check to make it visible only to yourself (unchecked by default, meaning public)

The new folder will appear in your favorites list immediately after creation.

## Private Folders

Private folders are not shown when other users visit your profile. Only you can see and access the contents of a private folder when logged in.

You can switch a folder between public and private at any time by editing it.

## Managing Folders

On your profile page under the **Favorites** tab, after switching to a folder, the top of the page shows the folder's name, description, and item count. The following actions are available on the right:

- **Edit** — Change the folder's name (cannot change name for the default folder), description, and privacy setting
- **Delete** — Permanently delete the folder and all its saved records; the default folder cannot be deleted

Deleting a folder does not affect the games themselves — only the saved associations are removed.

## Viewing Others' Favorites

Visit another user's profile and click the **Favorites** tab to view their public folders. Private folders are not visible to others.
