## What is PotatoVN

[PotatoVN](https://potatovn.net) is an open-source Windows visual novel / galgame management tool. It supports automatic local game detection, fetching game information from Bangumi/VNDB, tracking play time and status, and cloud save sync.

After linking your PotatoVN account with Shionlib, you can view PotatoVN play data directly on game pages in Shionlib, and add games to your PotatoVN library from Shionlib.

## Linking Your Account

Go to **Account Settings → Connected Accounts**, click **Connect Account**, and enter your PotatoVN username and password in the dialog.

> Your password is used only to request an access token from the PotatoVN server. It is not stored by Shionlib.

After a successful link, the page will display the connected account name and the token expiration date.

## Using It on Game Pages

Once your account is linked, a **PotatoVN** card appears on game entry pages with the following features:

### Add to Library

If the game has not been added to your PotatoVN library yet, click **Add to PotatoVN** to create a record directly.

### View Play Data

Games already in your library will display the following synced data:

| Field           | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Total Play Time | Cumulative play time                                  |
| Last Played     | Time of the last play session                         |
| Play Status     | Wish / Played / Playing / On Hold / Dropped           |
| My Rating       | Rating given in PotatoVN (shown when a rating exists) |

Data is synced from PotatoVN. The system runs a sync task every hour, and the last sync time is shown at the bottom of the card.

### Remove from Library

Click the **···** menu in the top-right corner of the card and select **Remove from PotatoVN** to delete all of the game's data from PotatoVN cloud, including play time and rating.

> This action permanently deletes game data from PotatoVN and cannot be undone. Please proceed with caution.

## Automatic Token Renewal

PotatoVN access tokens have an expiration date. The Shionlib backend automatically checks every 6 hours and **renews tokens with less than 3 days remaining**. In normal circumstances, no manual action is needed.

You can check the current token expiration date on the **Account Settings → Connected Accounts** page:

- When the date is shown in **orange**, the token will expire within 7 days (auto-renewal triggers when fewer than 3 days remain)
- When the date is shown in **red** with a "Token expired" label, auto-renewal has failed or the token has become fully invalid

If the token shows as expired, click **Disconnect** and re-link your account to restore it manually.

## Unlinking Your Account

Go to **Account Settings → Connected Accounts** and click **Disconnect** to remove the link between Shionlib and PotatoVN.

Unlinking only removes the account association — it does not delete any of your data in PotatoVN.
