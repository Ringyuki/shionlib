## Edit Entry Points

On any game, character, or developer entry page, click the **Edit** button to enter the edit page.

> All your edits are recorded and publicly visible to everyone.

## Permissions

The edit page only shows fields you currently have permission to modify.

Shionlib uses field-level permission control, where each field has its own edit permission. New users have editing access to some basic fields by default, but fields related to game type, NSFW tagging, external database IDs, etc. typically require elevated permissions.

If you find a field you cannot edit, you may request the corresponding edit permission from an administrator.

## Editing Game Info

The game edit page is divided into several sections, each submitted independently:

### Basic Info

Contains core metadata fields:

- **Title** — Game name in Chinese, English, and Japanese
- **Aliases** — Other names the game is commonly known by
- **Type** — Game type classification
- **Platform** — Platforms the game runs on
- **Release Date** — Release date, or marked as "TBD"
- **Introduction** — Descriptions in Chinese, English, and Japanese; supports BBCode format
- **Staff** — Director, writer, artist, and other production crew
- **Tags** — Classification tags for the game
- **Extra Info** — Custom key-value pairs for additional metadata
- **NSFW** — Whether the game contains adult content

After filling in the form, click **Submit Changes**. A confirmation dialog will appear showing all modified fields and a before/after comparison. Click **Submit** to save.

### Cover

Manage the game's cover images — supports adding, editing, and removing covers.

### Images

Manage the game's gallery images (non-cover) — supports adding, editing, and removing images.

### Developer / Studio

Manage associations between the game and developers — search and add existing developers, or remove existing associations.

### Characters

Manage the game's character list — search and link existing characters, and optionally specify character role and voice actor.

## Edit Notes

Each basic info section has an optional **Note** field at the bottom of the form. Use it to briefly describe the reason for your changes, such as "added release date" or "corrected title spelling", to help other users understand the context when reviewing edit history.

## Editing Developer Info

Developer entry pages also provide an edit entry point. You can edit the name, aliases, description, and other fields. The permission structure is the same as game editing.

## Editing Character Info

Character entry pages provide a separate edit entry point. You can edit the character name, description, gender, and other fields. The permission structure is the same.

## Edit History & Undo

All edits are recorded. Game, character, and developer entries all provide an edit history entry point, visible to everyone. Administrators can undo edits from the history. See [Edit History & Undo](/docs/guides/edit-history-and-undo).
