## Opening the Download Panel

On any game entry page, click the **Download** button near the top to open the download panel.

The panel lists all available resources for that game, sorted by download count from highest to lowest.

> All resources are uploaded by community members. Please verify file safety on your own.

## Reading the Resource Card Tags

Each resource card displays a set of tags at the top describing the scope of that resource.

### Platform

Indicates the platform(s) the resource runs on, such as **Windows**, **Android**, **iOS**, **PlayStation Vita**, etc.

A card may show multiple platforms, meaning the archive contains builds for multiple platforms or the resource runs cross-platform.

### Language

Indicates the language of the game or patch:

| Tag      | Meaning                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 日本語   | Japanese (original or Japanese patch)   |
| 简体中文 | Simplified Chinese localization         |
| 繁體中文 | Traditional Chinese localization        |
| English  | English version or English localization |
| Other    | Other languages                         |

### Emulator Engine (Android / iOS only)

Shown only when the platform is Android or iOS. Indicates the game engine the resource uses, helping you choose the right emulator:

| Tag             | Engine                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| KiriKiri (KRKR) | KiriKiri / KRKRZ engine                     |
| ONScripter      | ONScripter engine                           |
| Artemis         | Artemis Engine                              |
| Other Engine    | Other engines — refer to the resource notes |

For emulator recommendations per engine, see [Common Engines and Emulator Mapping](/en/docs/guides/common-vn-engines-and-emulators).

### Notes

Some resources include uploader-provided notes (shown below the file entry) describing the version, contents, or special requirements. It is recommended to read these before downloading.

## File Entry Details

Each resource card may contain one or more file entries, each showing:

- **File name and size** — confirm you are downloading the correct file
- **File status** — see below
- **Hash value** — used to verify file integrity after download

### File Status

| Status                   | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 (green)               | File is ready to download                                            |
| Processing (yellow)      | File is being scanned and uploaded — refresh shortly                 |
| Awaiting Upload          | File is queued for processing                                        |
| Visible to uploader only | File has not finished processing and is only visible to the uploader |

Only files with **S3** status can be downloaded.

## Downloading a File

Click the button on the right side of the file entry to start downloading. Before the link is generated, a **Cloudflare Turnstile** challenge (bot verification) will appear. The link is generated after you pass it.

> Download links have a time limit: files under 10 GB expire in **120 minutes**, files between 10–20 GB expire in **240 minutes**, and files over 20 GB expire in **360 minutes**. Complete your download before the link expires.

### Browser Download

Click the **globe icon** button to download directly through your browser. This works for most users.

### Push to Aria2

Click the **lightning icon** button to push the download link to a locally or remotely running Aria2 download manager.

Before using this, configure Aria2 connection details (protocol, host, port, secret, download path) in **Account Settings → Download Settings**. If the connection fails, an error will appear and you will be directed to the settings page.

## Verifying File Hash

After downloading, it is recommended to compare the hash to verify file integrity:

1. Copy the hash value shown in the file entry (click the copy button)
2. Calculate the hash of your downloaded file using a system tool or third-party software
3. Compare the two values — an exact match means the file is intact

Shionlib currently supports **BLAKE3** and **SHA-256** hash algorithms. The algorithm used is shown in the file entry.

## False Positive Virus Flag

If a file entry shows a red **"Possible virus"** tag, it means the automated scan previously detected a suspected virus signature, but an administrator reviewed it and confirmed it as a **false positive**, manually releasing the file.

The hover tooltip on the tag shows the detected virus name for your reference.

> Visual novel games (especially those using engines like KiriKiri) are **highly prone to antivirus false positives** due to their packaging methods. If the source is trustworthy, it is safe to proceed with the download.

## Update History

Click the **···** menu in the bottom-right of a resource card and select **Update History** to view all historical versions of that resource, including file size, hash, update time, and the uploader's update reason.

## Reporting a Resource

If you find a resource that violates rules (e.g., malware, copyright issues), click the **···** menu and select **Report Violation**, then fill in the reason. Malicious reports will be handled accordingly.
