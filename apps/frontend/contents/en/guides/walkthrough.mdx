## Viewing Walkthroughs

On a game entry page, click the **Walkthrough** tab at the top to see all published walkthroughs for that game.

Each walkthrough in the list shows the title, author, creation time, and the walkthrough's language label (if applicable). Click any entry to read the full content.

## Creating a Walkthrough

On the walkthrough list page, click the **Create Walkthrough** button in the top-right corner (login required) to open the editor.

The editor has two parts:

- **Title** — Required, max 50 characters
- **Body** — Write content using the rich-text editor, which supports headings, lists, bold, links, images, and other common formats

When finished, you can choose to **Save as Draft** or **Publish**.

## Draft vs. Published

| Action        | Status    | Visibility               |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Save as Draft | Draft     | Visible only to yourself |
| Publish       | Published | Visible to everyone      |

Walkthrough entries in draft status show a **Draft** badge in both the list and detail view, along with a notice saying "This walkthrough is a draft and is only visible to you." You can return to edit and publish at any time.

## Editing a Walkthrough

The walkthrough creator or an administrator can edit existing walkthroughs:

- **From the list** — Click the **···** menu in the top-right corner of the walkthrough card and select **Edit**
- **From the detail page** — Click the **Edit** button in the top-right corner of the walkthrough detail page

After editing, you can save as draft or re-publish. Once a walkthrough has been edited, a "last edited" timestamp will appear in both the list and detail view.

## Under Review Status

After clicking **Publish**, the walkthrough does not become visible immediately. It first enters **Under Review** status (shown with an orange "Under Review" badge), where it undergoes automated content moderation.

Once approved, the walkthrough's status automatically changes to published and becomes visible to everyone. If the review does not pass, the walkthrough remains hidden, and the author receives a system message explaining the reason.

> In normal circumstances, review completes within a short time after publishing. If a walkthrough remains "Under Review" for an extended period, contact an administrator.

## Deleting a Walkthrough

In the walkthrough list or on the walkthrough management page in your profile, click the **···** menu, select **Delete**, and confirm to permanently delete the walkthrough. This action cannot be undone.

Deletion is also restricted to the walkthrough creator or an administrator.

## Managing Walkthroughs in Your Profile

Visit your profile and switch to the **Walkthroughs** tab to manage all walkthroughs you have created.

Unlike the walkthrough list on a game page, this page provides a status filter navigation at the top, allowing you to view walkthroughs by **All / Published / Draft / Under Review**.

Each entry shows a game card associated with the walkthrough for quick navigation. You can also edit or delete via the **···** menu from here.

> The status filter navigation is only visible when you are viewing your own profile. When visiting someone else's profile, only their published walkthroughs are shown.
