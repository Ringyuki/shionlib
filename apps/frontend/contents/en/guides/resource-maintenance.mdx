## Who Can Maintain Resources

The **···** menu on a resource card contains maintenance options. The actions visible to you depend on your permissions:

- **Edit**, **Re-upload** — Only the original uploader or an administrator
- **Update History** — Visible to everyone
- **Report Violation** — Visible to non-uploaders

## Editing Resource Metadata

Click **···** → **Edit** to modify the descriptive metadata of a resource without touching the file itself:

- **File Name** — The display name of the resource (required, max 255 characters)
- **Platform** — Applicable platforms (at least one required), multi-select
- **Language** — Resource language (at least one required), multi-select
- **Emulator Engine** — Required when the platform includes Android or iOS; indicates which type of emulator is needed to run the resource
- **Notes** — Optional supplementary description (max 255 characters), such as version number, included content, or special requirements

Changes take effect immediately after saving.

## Re-uploading a File

When the original file needs to be updated, use the re-upload feature to replace the current file.

Click **···** → **Re-upload** to open the re-upload panel.

> Re-uploading replaces the current file. The old file will be deleted. This action cannot be undone.

**Steps:**

1. Confirm the current file information in the panel (file name, size, hash)
2. Enter the reason for this update in the **Update Reason** field
3. Select the new file and start the upload
4. After the upload completes, the system automatically submits the file for processing

After the update is complete, users who have favorited the game will receive an update notification containing the reason you entered.

### Re-upload Restrictions

The **Re-upload** option only appears when both of the following conditions are met:

- The resource has only one file
- The operator is the original uploader or an administrator

If you need to add additional files rather than replacing an existing one, use the **Upload** button on the game page to create a new resource entry.

### Update Reason Conventions

Write a concise description to help downloaders understand the nature of the update. Recommended formats:

- `Version update: v1.0 → v1.1`
- `Localization patch update: fixed several translation issues`
- `Merged localization patch, no separate installation needed`
- `Fixed corrupted file, re-download recommended`

The update reason appears in the update history and is included in notifications sent to users who favorited the game. Please fill it in carefully.

## Update History

Click **···** → **Update History** to view all historical versions of the resource.

Each entry includes:

- Version number
- File size
- Hash value and algorithm
- Update reason (if provided)
- Operator and update time

The version currently in use is marked with a **Current** badge.
