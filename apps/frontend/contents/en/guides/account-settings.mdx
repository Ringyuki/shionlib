Account settings are divided into five pages: **Personal Info**, **Security**, **Site Settings**, **Download Settings**, and **Connected Accounts**.

## Personal Info

### Changing Your Username

On the **Personal Info** page, click the username field to change your display name — up to 20 characters. Click **Update** to save.

### Changing Your Avatar

Click your current avatar to select a local image. A crop tool will appear to crop it to a 1:1 ratio. No additional confirmation is needed — the cropped image is submitted automatically.

## Security

### Changing Your Password

Fill in your current password and new password on the **Security** page. New password requirements:

- At least 8 characters
- Must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit
- Must not contain spaces

After a successful submission, you will be automatically logged out and will need to log back in. If you have forgotten your current password, click the **Forgot Password** link on the page.

### Changing Your Email

Changing your email requires a two-step verification:

1. The system sends a verification code to your current email — enter it to proceed
2. Enter your new email address, request a code sent to the new email, and enter it to complete the change

Verification codes are 6 alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive). There is a 60-second cooldown between code requests. After a successful change, you will also be automatically logged out.

### Passkeys

Passkeys are a passwordless login method that uses your device's biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition) or PIN for authentication.

**Adding a passkey:**

1. Click **Add Passkey** and optionally enter a name (up to 128 characters) to identify it
2. Your browser will display a verification prompt — follow it to complete biometric or PIN verification
3. After successful verification, the passkey is saved automatically and appears in the list

**Managing existing passkeys:**

Each passkey in the list shows its name, device type (synced / single-device / unknown), backup status, and last used time. Click the delete button to remove a passkey and confirm to apply.

> If your browser or device does not support WebAuthn, this feature will not be available.

## Site Settings

### NSFW Content Display

Controls how adult content is displayed on pages. Three options are available:

- **Never show** — Filters all NSFW content
- **Spoiler wrap** — Shows content behind a blur/mask; tap to reveal
- **Show directly** — Displays all content without any mask

Changes take effect immediately after re-login, or automatically after approximately 30 minutes.

### Language

Choose the interface language (简体中文, English, 日本語). The page will automatically switch to the selected language after saving.

### Notification Position

Set where notification toasts appear on screen — six positions are available. This setting is stored in your local browser only and is not synced to your account.

## Download Settings

Configure the Aria2 download client to push game resources to a locally or remotely running Aria2 instance.

| Field         | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Protocol      | HTTP or HTTPS                           |
| Host          | Aria2 address, e.g. `localhost`         |
| Port          | 1 – 65535                               |
| Path          | e.g. `/jsonrpc`                         |
| Auth Secret   | Aria2 RPC Secret (if set)               |
| Download Path | Leave empty to use Aria2's default path |

After filling in the fields, click **Test Connection** to verify the configuration. Click **Reset** to restore all fields to their default values.

This setting is stored in your local browser only and is not synced to your account.
