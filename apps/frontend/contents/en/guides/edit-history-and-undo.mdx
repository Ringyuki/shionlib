## Viewing Edit History

Game, character, and developer entries all provide an edit history entry point, visible to everyone.

Each history record includes:

- Editor's avatar and username
- List of fields modified (shown as tags)
- Edit note (if provided — click to expand)
- Edit timestamp
- Edit record number (e.g. `#123`)

If a record has been undone by an administrator, it will show a red **Undone** badge. If a record is itself an undo operation, the title will show **Undid #number**, referencing the original record.

## Change Comparison

Click a history record to expand and view the specific changes:

- **Text fields**: Character-level highlighted diff between before and after content — green for additions, red for deletions
- **Relations** (covers, images, developers, characters, etc.): Separate lists of added and removed entries, along with a before/after comparison

## Undoing Edits (Administrators)

Administrators can undo any edit in the history that has not already been undone. Click the **Undo this edit** button on a record, select the undo mode in the dialog, and confirm.

### Strict Mode

Undoes only the target record without touching other edits.

- If a later edit modified the same fields, the system detects a conflict and refuses the operation
- Enabling the **Force** option bypasses conflict detection and forces execution, but may cause data inconsistencies — use with caution

Best for: recent edits with no dependent follow-up edits.

### Cascade Mode

Before undoing the target record, automatically undoes all conflicting follow-up edits in reverse chronological order, then undoes the target itself. The entire process runs in a database transaction to ensure atomicity.

Best for: older edits that have dependent follow-up edits that need to be cleaned up together.

### Undo Record Entry

After a successful undo, the system writes a new record to the edit history labeled **Undid #number**, and marks the original record with an **Undone** badge, forming a complete audit trail.

> Each edit record can only be undone once.
